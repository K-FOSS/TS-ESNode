This is a Node.JS Loader hook for Node.JS 13.9 or newer that transpiles TypeScript files into JavaScript using the `getFormat`, `resolve`, and `transformSource` hooks.

For Node.JS use `npm install @k-foss/ts-esnode@latest`

## Usage

You should already have `"type": "module"` in your `package.json`

Install `@k-foss/ts-esnode`

Create a `dev` script in `package.json`

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "node --loader @k-foss/ts-esnode --experimental-specifier-resolution=node ./src/index.ts",
  }
}
```

Now when you run `npm run dev` then you should be running your TypeScript source without having to transpile it while still retaining Node.JS ESModule & ESNext module mode.

## Development

### Setting up the development container

Follow these steps to open this project in a container:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).

2. To use this repository, you can either open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:

   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Open Repository in Container...** command.
   - Enter `K-FOSS/TS-ESNode`
   - The VS Code window (instance) will reload, clone the source code, and start building the dev container. A progress notification provides status updates.

   Or open a locally cloned copy of the code:

   - Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
     - `git clone https://github.com/K-FOSS/TS-ESNode.git`
   - Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
     - `code ./TS-ESNode`
   - Reopen in Container

     - When you open the project folder in Visual Studio Code you should be prompted with a notification asking if you would like to reopen in container.

     Or manually reopen

     - Press F1 and select the "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container..." command.

#### TODO

- Worker Threads to avoid the TypeScript compiling affecting main thread.

- Performance improvements. (Better file/import finding.)

### Testing

**MUST HAVE NODE.JS v13.9 or newer**

To try this out, clone repo

Install NPM modules

```
npm install
```

Run all tests under [`./Testing/Tests/`](./Testing/Tests/)

```
npm test
```

All tests are run on all commits and PRs.

### Style

This project currently uses Prettier for code styling and automatic formatting. Prettier is run on every commit and pull request.

Run Prettier

```
npm run prettier
```

### Linting

This project currently uses ESLint for code linting. ESLint is run on every commits and pull request.

Run ESLint

```
npm run lint
```

### Dependency Management

Dependency Management for TS-ESNode is handled by automated pull requests created by [Dependabot](https://github.com/marketplace/dependabot-preview). When new released of development Dependencies are released Dependabot automatically creates a pull request for upgrading to the new version. If the created pull request passes the GitHub Actions testing, prettier/styling, and linting I will merge the pull request.

### Releases

@K-FOSS/TS-ESNode uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to intelligently automate the creation of a changelog, automatic package publish to NPM, along with creating a GitHub release and tag.

Semantic-Release is currently configured to analyze commits with the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) preset to determine if and how the package version should be incremented and if a release should be published, which is why it is important to mantain the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) spec for all commits.
