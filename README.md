# TS-ESNode

This is a Node.JS Loader hook for Node.JS 13.7 or newer that transpiles TypeScript files into JavaScript using the `getFormat`, `resolve`, and `transformSource` hooks.

## Usage

You should already have `"type": "module"` in your `package.json`

Install `@k-foss/ts-esnode`

Create a `dev` script in `package.json`

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "node --loader @k-foss/ts-esnode --experimental-specifier-resolution=node ./src/index.ts",
  }
}
```

Now when you run `npm run dev` then you should be running your TypeScript source without having to transpile it while still retaining Node.JS ESModule & ESNext module mode.

## Development

Development is intened to be done using VSCode with the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extensions.

When you open this folder in VSCode you should get a notication to reopen in container. Click the reopen in container button to build the development contianer and launch VSCode in remote coding.
